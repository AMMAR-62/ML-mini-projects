**Dog Breed Prediction**
 - Keras and Tensorflow to build, train, and test a convolutional neural network.

**STEPS to solve the problem**
 - Load labels csv for labels that contain image id and breed.
 - checking the breed count
 - one-hot encoding on labels data prediction column
 - load the images, convert them to an array and normalize them.
 - check the shape and size of x and y data.
 - building the model network architecture
 - split the data and fit it into the model and create an accuracy model.
 - evaluate the model for accuracy score.
 - using the model for prediction
